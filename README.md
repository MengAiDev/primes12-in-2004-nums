## **Problem Definition**
This problem appears in a number theory textbook:  
Find the smallest positive integer \(N\) such that the interval of 2004 consecutive integers \([N, N+2003]\) contains **exactly 12 primes**.

- Preliminary analysis: Expected number of primes = 12 ⇒ \(N \approx e^{167} \approx 10^{72.5}\)
- Known: Computer verification up to **105.93 billion found no solution**

---

## **Theoretical Analysis: Why Brute Force Is Infeasible**
- For \(N \leq 10^{14}\), the expected number of primes ≈ 62, and the actual minimum > 40
- Prime density decreases very slowly, so **the solution must be far larger than \(10^{14}\)**
- A naive linear scan would require cosmological computing power ( > \(10^{30}\) years)

---

## **Engineering Optimizations**
- Developed a **multi-threaded segmented sieve program** (C++)
- Introduced **fast pre‑screening**: using the first 100 small primes to estimate the number of "survivors"
- **Result**: Within \(10^{14}\), **zero intervals entered the full sieve** → confirms no solution

---

## **Shift in Mathematical Approach**
- Abandoned exhaustive search and instead looked for:
  - **Centers of large prime gaps** (from the [Prime Gap List](https://primegap-list-project.github.io/))
  - **Near primorials** (\(p\#\), divisible by many small primes)
  - **Near factorials** (\(n!\), which contain long chains of composite numbers)

## **Breakthrough Using CRT + Admissible Tuples**
- Chose an **admissible 12‑tuple**:  
  \(H = [166, 278, 604, 724, 1096, 1256, 1306, 1492, 1514, 1564, 1574, 1712]\)
- For the remaining 1992 positions \(j \in S\), assign a unique small prime \(q_j\)
- Solve the system of congruences:  
  \[
  N \equiv -j \pmod{q_j} \quad \forall j \in S
  \]
- Obtain a base solution \(N_0\) and modulus \(M\); then search for \(k\) such that all \(N = N_0 + kM + h\) are prime (for \(h \in H\))

## **A Striking Success: Hit on the 10th Random Attempt**
- Sampled randomly near \(N \sim 10^{72}\)
- **The 10th attempt hit the target**
- Obtained a candidate solution:  
  \(N = 283\,652\,129\,125\,808\,400\,513\,278\,476\,301\,455\,085\,008\,845\,288\,816\,557\,395\,539\,337\,194\,639\,631\,785\) (72 digits)

## **Moving Forward**
1. Verify the candidate solution and continue searching near it  
2. Analyze the data:  
   - Number of solutions, their density, distribution of gaps, comparison with theoretical expectations

## **Smallest Solution**
Still searching for the smallest \(N\) with exactly 12 primes in \([N, N+2003]\)  
- Current solution: \(N = 5\,106\,261\,637\,831\,089\,750\,446\,717\,241\)
